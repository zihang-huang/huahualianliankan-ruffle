# Using Ruffle for hosting 花花连连看

> Ruffle is an Adobe Flash Player emulator written in the Rust programming language. Ruffle targets both the desktop and the web using WebAssembly.

This repo is only intended for using Ruffle and github pages to host the game 花花连连看 for my grandma. She really loves that flash game :)

I do not own the .swf file in this repository. Please contact me if you own the copyright of the game, and you do not wish me to host it.
